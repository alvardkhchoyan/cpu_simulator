registers in cpu simulator _ r0, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9

mov _ The mov instruction copies the data item referred to by its second operand into the location referred to by its first operand.

add _ The add instruction adds together its two operands, storing the result in its first operand.

sub _ The sub instruction stores in the value of its first operand the result of subtracting the value of its second operand from the value of its first operand.

inc _ The inc instruction increments the contents of its operand by one.

dec _ The dec instruction decrements the contents of its operand by one.

mul _ The mul multiplies its two operands together and stores the result in the first operand.

div _ The div instruction stores in the value of its first operand the result of divide the value of its second operand from the value of its first operand. 

jmp _ The JMP instruction performs an unconditional jump. 

Conditional Jump _ These instructions are conditional jumps that are based on the status of a set of condition codes. Based on these condition codes, a number of conditional jumps can be performed. Otherwise, control proceeds to the next instruction in sequence.
   
      je  _ jump when equal
   
      jne _ jump when not equal
   
      jg  _ jump when greater than
   
      jge _ jump when greater than or equal to
   
      jl  _ jump when less than
   
      jle _ jump when less than or equal to

cmp _ Compare the values of the two specified operands.
